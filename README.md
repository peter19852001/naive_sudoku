# naive_sudoku
To archive my old code of a naive sudoku solver.

This was written years ago as a fun little exercise in coding that I recently revisit.

Probably the coding style does not represent best practice.

For fun and testing, the main function to use is solve-sudoku-list, as in

```
(solve-sudoku-list
   '(0 0 0  3 0 5  0 6 0
     3 0 7  6 0 4  0 0 0
     0 8 0  0 0 9  3 0 4

     9 0 0  1 3 0  0 0 8
     0 6 4  0 2 0  9 7 0
     8 0 0  0 4 7  0 0 1

     2 0 5  8 0 0  0 9 0
     0 0 0  7 0 3  2 0 5
     0 9 0  4 0 2  0 0 0))
 ```
